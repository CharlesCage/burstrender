## Description

BurstRender analyzes a folder full of CR3 photos (shot with a Canon R3), identifies bursts of photos, and then automates RawTherapee, ImageMagick, and ffmpeg to render each of the bursts as an MP4, a motion-stabilized MP4, and a GIF. It's kinda hacky, but I threw it together for a friend who photographs his daughter's softball team and wanted an easy way to generate parent- and player-friendly movies and GIFs from the thousands of photos he shoots at eachgame.
